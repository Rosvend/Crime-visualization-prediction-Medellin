# Crime Visualization and Prediction in Medellín

## Overview
This project aims to **visualize high-risk crime areas** and **predict where crimes are likely to occur** in Medellín, Colombia. By analyzing historical crime data, we provide insights into crime trends and help identify potential hotspots for future incidents.

## Team
- **Data Scientist:** Roy Sandoval @rosvend
- **Software Engineers:** Fernando Gonzales @fergonzr, Argenis Omaña @4rg3n15, Valentina Sánchez @valentinaSV1028

The project includes:
- **Interactive maps** to visualize crime locations and hotspots.
- **Charts and graphs** to analyze crime trends over time.
- **Machine learning models** to predict high-risk areas.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
1. **Visualize Crime Data:**
   - Provide an interactive map to display crime locations and densities.
   - Show trends and patterns in crime data over time.
2. **Predict Crime Hotspots:**
   - Use machine learning to predict areas with a high likelihood of future crimes.
3. **Support Decision-Making:**
   - Help law enforcement, city planners, and the public make informed decisions about safety and resource allocation.

## Target Audience
- **Law Enforcement:** Identify high-risk areas for targeted patrols.
- **City Planners:** Understand crime patterns to improve urban safety.
- **General Public:** Stay informed about crime trends in their neighborhoods.
